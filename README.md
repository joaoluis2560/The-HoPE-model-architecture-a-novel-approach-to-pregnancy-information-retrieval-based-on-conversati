# Pre-trained-Portuguese-BERT-models-applied-for-retrieval-pregnancy-information
Conversational agents are used to communicating with humans in a friendly manner. To achieve the highest level of performance, agents need to respond assertively and fastly. Architectures that use Transformers are shown to produce excellent performances on recent tasks, however, for tasks involving Q\&amp;A and Conversational agents they may have a lower performance in terms of speed. The present work aims to explore two pre-trained BERT models in the Portuguese Language for information retrieval tasks,  trained with the two different strategies
